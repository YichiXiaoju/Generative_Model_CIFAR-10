# Generative Models on CIFAR-10

This repository provides a modular implementation of several generative models, including:

- **DDPM** (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models)  
- **DDIM** (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models)  
- (Planned) **Flow Matching** and **Rectified Flow**

The goal is to train and compare different diffusion and flow-based generative models on CIFAR-10 in a unified framework.
